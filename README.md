# Flatadango

## Project Overview

Flatadango is a movie ticketing system where users can browse available movies, view detailed information about each movie, and purchase tickets. It provides an easy-to-use interface for users to check available movies, see details like showtimes and ticket availability, and purchase tickets online. The system also displays a "Sold-out" message if no tickets are available for a movie



## Features

- **Movie Menu**: A menu on the left side displays all available movies.
- **Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie displays detailed information, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
- **Ticket Purchase**: Users can buy tickets for available movies.
- **Sold-out Error**: If a movie is sold out, an error message is displayed indicating no available tickets.
